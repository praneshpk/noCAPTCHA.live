Relative URIs\n// in the browser can feel awkward because not only can you be \"in a directory\"\n// you can be \"at a file\", too. For example\n//\n//     browserSpecResolve('foo', '/bar/') => /bar/foo\n//     browserSpecResolve('foo', '/bar') => /foo\n//\n// But on the command line of a file system, it's not as complicated, you can't\n// `cd` from a file, only directories.  This way, links have to know less about\n// their current path. To go deeper you can do this:\n//\n//     <Link to=\"deeper\"/>\n//     // instead of\n//     <Link to=`{${props.uri}/deeper}`/>\n//\n// Just like `cd`, if you want to go deeper from the command line, you do this:\n//\n//     cd deeper\n//     # not\n//     cd $(pwd)/deeper\n//\n// By treating every path as a directory, linking to relative paths should\n// require less contextual information and (fingers crossed) be more intuitive.\nvar resolve = function resolve(to, base) {\n  // /foo/bar, /baz/qux => /foo/bar\n  if (startsWith(to, \"/\")) {\n    return to;\n  }\n\n  var _to$split = to.split(\"?\"),\n      toPathname = _to$split[0],\n      toQuery = _to$split[1];\n\n  var _base$split = base.split(\"?\"),\n      basePathname = _base$split[0];\n\n  var toSegments = segmentize(toPathname);\n  var baseSegments = segmentize(basePathname);\n\n  // ?a=b, /users?b=c => /users?a=b\n  if (toSegments[0] === \"\") {\n    return addQuery(basePathname, toQuery);\n  }\n\n  // profile, /users/789 => /users/789/profile\n  if (!startsWith(toSegments[0], \".\")) {\n    var pathname = baseSegments.concat(toSegments).join(\"/\");\n    return addQuery((basePathname === \"/\" ?
